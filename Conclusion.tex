\section{Conclusion}
    For our simulation, we used the same parameter of the following article~\cite{}
    
    There are many improvement and expansion that we can do in this project:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this website \cite{performanceGraphTool}, is shown that the library NetworkX has not very good performance. They made a benchmark and the comparison between igraph~\cite{igraph} and NetworkX and the result is quite evident. Igraph is more then ten time faster than NetworkX, so, in order to have a better scalability and make more efficient the simulation, we could convert our tool using this library.
