\section{Conclusion}
    In conclusion, we analysed the difference among this different network and we find out that the behaviour of the preferential attachment network is the best one taken in analysis to simulate the real network for disease spreading.
    
    There are many improvements and expansion that we can do in this project:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this website \cite{performanceGraphTool}, is shown that the library NetworkX has not very good performances. They made a benchmark and the comparison between igraph~\cite{igraph} and NetworkX and the result is quite evident. Igraph is more than ten time faster than NetworkX, so, in order to have a better scalability and make more efficient the simulation, we could convert our tool using this library.
        \item We could evaluate the behaviour in other kind of network like Barabasi-Albert model, and in general scale free.
        \item In the epidemic model we can also add the vaccination state in order to analyse the behaviour of this different network and in particular we can analyse some interesting features in order to improve the efficiency of vaccination with limited resources.
        \item ...
